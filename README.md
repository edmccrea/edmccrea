- 👋 Hi, I’m @edmccrea
- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript, Node, Mongoose, React, CSS, HTML
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development from the start. I'm using a bunch of different resources including FreeCodeCamp, Udemy Courses, CS50 etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. I'm not sure I could contribute in a meaningful way at this moment. I will as soon as I can though!
